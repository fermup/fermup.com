This week is about salt and the amazing osmoprotectants that come to the rescue in lactic acid bacteria. We discuss a few historical aspects of salt, a bit about iodine and then we discuss what happens to bacteria under the influence of salt. 

We're also trying a new format order for the show. We started with the topic of the week and finished off with fermentation news.

While iodine can have anti-microbial effects at high doses, the amount in table salt is not enough to halt lactic acid fermentation. More likely, the anecdotal accounts of ferments not working is due to some other improper step in the process, but that iodine is used as the scape goat. Iodine may, however, make your ferments look less appealing.
