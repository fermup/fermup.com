Allison Wells is a graduate of the Purdue University School of Food Science. While at Purdue, she spent a summer working in France on a small, family owned winery where she helped with odd jobs and selling wine at the local farmers markets and wine shops. This experience sparked her interest in fermentation and a desire to learn more about microbiology and biochemistry. After graduation, she completed an internship at E&J Gallo Winery in their enology research lab. Allison was also awarded a two-year assistantship at Oregon State University, earning a M.S. in Food and Fermentation Science, with a focus on wine microbiology. Upon graduation Allison was hired by White Labs, a small yeast production company in San Diego. She spent three years as their yeast culture specialist, acting as a curator of over 100 yeast and bacteria strains, as well as directing the bacteria & wild yeast lab. Allison became an expert in native isolates and helped to discover Rogue's 'Beard Yeast'. She is currently working at a freelance fermentation scientist helping the local San Diego community to better understand fermentation, food science, and urban microflora.
