This week we discuss bread and sourdough through the eyes of the beginning bread baker. A little bit of history, a little bit of how to and a tiny bit of science.  We also discuss Limburger cheese and the only cheese making cooperative that still produces it in the US. Plus, we follow up on the cow birthing cycle/wet nurse questions from last week and share a tiny update on the mimolette mite story.

[Monroe, Wisconsin -- Home Of Limburger, The World's Stinkiest Cheese | Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/08/visit-monroe-wisconsin-stinky-cheese-limburger_n_3239545.html)

A sign in Monroe, Wisconsin says "Limburger: don't eat it with your nose." Now the only cheese making cooperative in the US still making Limburger cheese with it's horribly smelly to many, but for those whom love it, they really do love it.

Finally, a bigger news source in the US is reporting on this cheese debacle. There's no official limit cheese mite imports according to the FDA's Patricia El-Hinnawy, but six inches per square inch is the target.

Hand Taste

Michael Pollan says, "hand taste is the taste of love."

[Tartine Bread | Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0811870413/fermup-20)

If you're new to bread baking or are searching for some new techniques, this book is awesome and covers the steps of sourdough bread making in detail.

[The Making of Tartine Bread | Youtube](http://youtu.be/r5kKeKSfyOE)

This is a short video on the process of testing the basic country bread recipe in the Tartine Bread book.

[Lodge Combo Cooker | Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0009JKG9M/fermup-20)

This is the combo dutch oven that is referred to in the Tartine book. We haven't tried it yet, but have one on order from Amazon and will share how it works as a steam oven alternative.
