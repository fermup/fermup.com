This week's conversation is about the intersection between science and tradition in modern food fermentation kitchens and labs. Many chefs, small-scale producers and hobbyists desire a deeper understanding of what is going on inside of their ferments. We also discuss how to make a kombucha culture from "scratch," the success of commercial kefir, and a wine by-product that could increase dietary fibre in your yogurt.
