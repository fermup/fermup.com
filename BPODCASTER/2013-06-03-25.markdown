[Handbook of Fermented Functional Foods, Second Edition | Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1420053264/fermup-20)

Check out chapter 18 for more detail on fermented foods in Thailand. The rest of the chapters cover different fermented food topics. Good book, but probably worth checking for at your local library as opposed to purchasing unless you are a total fermented food nerd.

[Thai Food by David Thompson | Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1580084621/fermup-20)

This book is packed full of Thai recipes and insight into Thai cuisine. Specifically about fermentation, this book covers fermented bamboo shoots, fermented bean curd, fermented fish, fermented fish relish, fermented fish sauce, fermented pork sausages, fermented rice, fermented siamese watercress and fermented soy beans. This is the cookbook that I can never remember the title of, but in reality the title is so simple.

Grilled shrimp paste, yum.
