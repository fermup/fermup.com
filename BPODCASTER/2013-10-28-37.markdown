Show notes:

[BBC Radio 4 - Food Programme, Sourdough](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01mnpzv)

Great episode of the BBC Food Programme featuring Sourdough. Definitely worth listening to if you like sourdough.

[Nourishing Traditions by Sally Fallon | Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0967089735/fermup-20)

The cookbook that seems to have started the idea of using whey as a starter culture for vegetable and grain ferments.

[Wild Fermentation | Fermentation makes foods more nutritious, as well as delicious! | Wild Fermentation](http://www.wildfermentation.com/)

Sandor Katz's website. A great resource for links and information about fermentation. Also be sure to check his schedule of events to see if he will be in your area soon.

[The Art of Fermentation Audiobook Edition | Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00BPUXOCA/fermup-20)

You listen to podcasts, so why not listen to the entire unabridged version of The Art of Fermentation. It's over 20 hours of amazing information. We haven't listened to this yet, but look forward to digesting the book in a whole new way!

[The Art of Fermentation: An In-Depth Exploration of Essential Concepts and Processes from around the World by Sandor Ellix Katz | Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/160358286X/fermup-20)

If you are interested in fermentation, this is the book to have.

[Wild Fermentation: The Flavor, Nutrition, and Craft of Live-Culture Foods by Sandor Ellix Katz | Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1931498237/fermup-20)

This was the original book that inspired Branden's foray into fermentation and food awareness. While not a necessary read if you plan to or have already read the Art of Fermentation, it still makes a great gift for those not ready for the big orange book.

[Wild Fermentation: A Do-it-yourself Guide to Cultural Manipulation - The Original Pamphlet | Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1934620173/fermup-20)

We haven't read this pamphlet, but it is the original version of the Wild Fermentation book and might be interesting for those whom can never get enough Sandor Katz.
