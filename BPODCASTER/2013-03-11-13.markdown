This week we talk about what not to do with kefir grains, a bit of history behind the people who originally drank kumis, whether marijuana infused kombucha is a gimmick or not, our thoughts on plastic kraut pouches with one-way valves, probiotic steering wheels, water kefir carbonation, and then we share the news that black garlic is not actually fermented.

We will be attending the Good Food Festival in Chicago on Saturday, March 16th. There will be a lot of fermented food workshops there including Sandor Katz's three hours of fermentation. Will you be there? If so, let us know on Facebook or Twitter.
