Inspired by a recent presentation on the microbes of beer, we discuss fermented food contamination. Contamination happens. Sometimes food is salvageable and other times it must be composted. What is going wrong when this happens?

We mentioned this talk last week. Watch it if you are interested in microbes or beer or both.

This is the book on fermentation that was written by one of the presenters from the Microbes After Hours talk on beer. This book has a large section on beer, but covers general science on many different categories of ferments. Well worth reading if you're into text books and knowledge!
