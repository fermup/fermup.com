**When fermenting vegetables in a mason jar, it is important to keep the vegetables below the brine. Here is a quick tip for making the process simple by using a 4oz mason jar inside a wide-mouth jar.**

During the fermentation process, mold begins to form on the surface of vegetables exposed to air. If fermenting in mason jars, it is a common practice to open the mason jar and manually push the vegetables below the surface of the brine on a daily basis. If you prefer a simpler method then watch the video below to see an example of using a wide-mouth mason jar along with a 4oz mason jar inside.
