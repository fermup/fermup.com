**Here is my second attempt at dehydrating fermented vegetables. This time I tried a plain and spicy version of dehydrated garlic dill grean beans (a.k.a. dilly beans).**

This isn't about creating survival food. For me, this is about flavor exploration. In this second attempt at fermented vegetables, the flavor of the garlic dill green beans tasted surprislingly similar to sauerkraut once dehydrated. If you haven't tried the [sour cabbage crisps](http://fermup.com/blog/fermented-dehydration-how-to-make-sour-cabbage-chips/), then I recommend starting there if you want to follow along on my journey.

Don't squeeze out the garlic dill grean beans before dehydrating. Removing as much liquid as possible does make for faster dehydration, however, the texture and crunch of the final dehydrated bean is affected. If you do decide to squeeze, then the dehydration will be closer to 6 hours as opposed to 9 hours. Since these expirements are about taste and mouthfeel, I opted for not squeezing my second batch.

In the second batch, I also decided to add additional seasoning. Below you will find my directions for a spicy dilly bean crisp.

**Ingredients**
<div>
	<ul class="check-list">
		<li>1/2 lb fermented green beans (approximate)</li>
		<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
		<li>2 tablespoons parmesan</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon oregano</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon cracked black pepper</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
	</ul>
</div>
&nbsp;

**Directions**
<div>
	<ul class="colored-counter-list">
		<li>Remove previously fermented green beans from brine.</li>
		<li>Place the grean beans in a bowl and mix with oil, parmesan, oregano, black pepper, and cayenne pepper.</li>
		<li>Place the flavored green beans onto dehydrator trays.</li>
		<li>Dehydrate for 9 hours at 120&deg;F (48&deg;C).</li>
	</ul>
</div>

The final spicy crisp tastes good but I will probably continue testing out different seasoning combinations. Any kind of seasoning that goes well with garlic, dill and lactic acid tartness will work great.

I'm thinking dehydrated kimchi is in order for an upcoming round...
