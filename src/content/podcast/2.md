This week we discuss how to make yogurt from store bought yogurt and heirloom yogurt starters. If you have never made yogurt at home before, this is the episode for you. If you're already a pro yogurt maker, you might learn a few new things about the bacteria and heirloom varietals of yogurt.

Sorry for the poor quality audio. It gets better in the following episodes!
